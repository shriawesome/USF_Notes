    "## Assembly language:\n",
    "1. ldr vs mov :\n",
    "    - ldr saves ref to the memory address in the register whereas mov saves the value as the instruction in the register\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/ldrmov.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\" />\n",
    "2. Processor :\n",
    "    - Processor state is the value in the registers and a set of ways to execute the instructions.\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/mem.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\" />\n",
    "    - E.g. mov r0,#2 (instruction word) mov r1,#3, add r5,r0,r1\n",
    "    - Processor looks for PC[Program Counter] that points in the memory to look for the code to be executed.\n",
    "    - Word size is 32 bit and registers are also the word size for 32 bit processor. Instruction are also word size\n",
    "    - Memory is nothing but array of bytes and addressed via `byte address` and set of words can be accessed via `word address`\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/mem2.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\" />\n",
    "    - **Byte Order**\n",
    "        * word = 0x22BB55AA, each set of 2 words would occupy a byte say 22, BB, 55, AA and arranged in an array, and can be arranged with MSB be at the bottom most(big endian) or MSB at the very top(little endian).\n",
    "        * An architecture has to decide which order it'll use.\n",
    "        * gdb \\<exc filename> , x/4xb 0xbefff3e[mem addr]\n",
    "3. Memory Instructions:\n",
    "    - Control Instructions : b,ble,beq,bl(call a function) and bx(return from a function)\n",
    "    - Memory Instructions:\n",
    "        * ldr : load data into a register(word)\n",
    "        * str : stores data into memory from a register\n",

    "        * RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer), CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer).\n",
    "        * ARM is called Load/ Store Machine as it gives access to memory only using specific instructions.\n",
    "            - Does this make it slow ? Not necessarily as the instruction sets for add r0,[r1],[r2] is large and the logic to decode these instructions are very complicated as compared to simple load/ str machine instructions.\n",
    "4. SUM ARRAY\n",
    "    - array += 1, actually adds 4 to the array, i.e. incrementing int to next int i.e. 4 bytes\n",
    "    - Check for `int sum_array_c()` to assembly\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/memarray.png\" align=\"center\" />\n",
    "    - sum = sum + array[i] -> ldr r12,[r0,r2,lsl #2] -> r12 = \\*(array + r2 << 2) and we need not update array pointer anymore.\n",

    "1. Allocate Space on Stack\n",
    "    - `sub sp,sp,#16` gives us space of 4 words\n",
    "    - Rule : **sp must be a multiple of 8(ABI : Application Binary Interface)(Evolution of ARM optimised memory Instructions to be multiple of 8)**\n",
    "    - Deallocate:\n",
    "        - `add sp,sp,#16`\n",
    "    - Usage :\n",
    "        - if we want to use more registers that the one that are preserved.\n",
    "        - if we want to call another function we overwrite 'lr' register, so in order to preserve the function that called the code we want to not overwrite lr register.\n",
    "        - We want to allocate an array then we can use an array\n",
    "        - More than 4 arguments than we can use the stack to pass in additional arguments.\n",
    "2. Branch and Link\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/brlnk.png\" align=\"center\" />\n",
    "3. Code e.g. :\n",
    "    - when we call another function we need to preserve lr to preserve the caller function and hence sub and str in the beginning\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/codeeg2.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" height=\"20%\" />\n",
