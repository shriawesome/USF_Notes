    "    - Human readable/ writable form of the processor's machine code.\n",
    "    - Assembler -> Translate Code to the Machine Code.\n",
    "    - Assembly language helps us to write code in the form of Instructions. E.g. ADD r0,r1\n",
    "    - Registers : Variables of the processors(16 of them r0- r15)\n",
    "        * ro - r12, r13 : SP[Stack Pointer], r14 : LR[Linker Register], r15 : PC[Program Counter], r17 : CPSR[Current Program Startor Register] \n",

    "## Assembly language:\n",
    "1. ldr vs mov :\n",
    "    - ldr saves ref to the memory address in the register whereas mov saves the value as the instruction in the register\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/ldrmov.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\" />\n",
    "2. Processor :\n",
    "    - Processor state is the value in the registers and a set of ways to execute the instructions.\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/mem.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"30%\" height=\"30%\" />\n",
    "    - E.g. mov r0,#2 (instruction word) mov r1,#3, add r5,r0,r1\n",
    "    - Processor looks for PC[Program Counter] that points in the memory to look for the code to be executed.\n",
    "    - Word size is 32 bit and registers are also the word size for 32 bit processor. Instruction are also word size\n",
    "    - Memory is nothing but array of bytes and addressed via `byte address` and set of words can be accessed via `word address`\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/mem2.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\" />\n",
    "    - **Byte Order**\n",
    "        * word = 0x22BB55AA, each set of 2 words would occupy a byte say 22, BB, 55, AA and arranged in an array, and can be arranged with MSB be at the bottom most(big endian) or MSB at the very top(little endian).\n",
    "        * An architecture has to decide which order it'll use.\n",
    "        * gdb \\<exc filename> , x/4xb 0xbefff3e[mem addr]\n",
    "3. Memory Instructions:\n",
    "    - Control Instructions : b,ble,beq,bl(call a function) and bx(return from a function)\n",
    "    - Memory Instructions:\n",
    "        * ldr : load data into a register(word)\n",
    "        * str : stores data into memory from a register\n",
    "        * e.g. ldr r0,[r1] -> r0 = *r1, str r0,[r1] -> r0 : src and [r1] : dest\n",
    "        * RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer), CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer).\n",
    "        * ARM is called Load/ Store Machine as it gives access to memory only using specific instructions.\n",
    "            - Does this make it slow ? Not necessarily as the instruction sets for add r0,[r1],[r2] is large and the logic to decode these instructions are very complicated as compared to simple load/ str machine instructions.\n",
    "4. SUM ARRAY\n",
    "    - array += 1, actually adds 4 to the array, i.e. incrementing int to next int i.e. 4 bytes\n",
    "    - Check for `int sum_array_c()` to assembly\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/memarray.png\" align=\"center\" />\n",
    "    - sum = sum + array[i] -> ldr r12,[r0,r2,lsl #2] -> r12 = \\*(array + r12 << 2) and we need not update array pointer anymore.\n",
