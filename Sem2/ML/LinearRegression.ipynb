    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "1. Assumptions:\n",
    "    * **Linearity**: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.\n",
    "    * **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.\n",
    "    * **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "    * **Normality**: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.\n",
    "2. Model : Algorithm + data + Hyperparameter forms a model.\n",
    "3. Testing and Training : <....>\n",
    "4. Regression Types :\n",
    "    * Parametric\n",
    "        - Assumption y = f(x)\n",
    "        - Function applies to all values of x\n",
    "        - Learning means deciding on the function / parameters / weights.\n",
    "        - e.g. SVM, least square errors\n",
    "    * Non-parametic :\n",
    "        - No assumption on the dataset values\n",
    "        - e.g. k-means\n",
    "5. Linear model needs less data to train, easy to fit a line.\n",
    "6. Linear regression has a high bias and low variance.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/linear1.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\" />\n",
    "7. Gradient descent is a convex shaped curve, as it is obtained from sum of squares of the errors and hence parabola.\n",
    "8. Gradient Descent:\n",
    "    * Batch-gradient descent : update weights after training on entire dataset.\n",
    "    * Stochastic gradient descent : Update weight after training on single data point.\n",
    "    * Mini-batch gradient Descent : Update weights after training on some number of instances."
